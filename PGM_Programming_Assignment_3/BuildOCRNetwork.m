function allFactors = BuildOCRNetwork (images, imageModel, pairwiseModel, tripletList)
% This function constructs the Markov network for one word by putting
% together the full list of different types of factors.
%
% Input:
%   images: A struct array of the images for each character in the word.
%   imageModel: The provided image model.
%   pairwiseModel: The provided pairwise factor model.
%   tripletList: The provided triplet factor list.
%
% Output:
%   allFactors: An array of factor structs that constitutes the full Markov
%     network.
%
% NOTE:
% The default implementation of each ConstructFactors function returns an
% empty list, so as you implement each of those in succession, more and
% more factors will be added to the resulting network.
%
% You can control which factors are added after you've implemented all of
% the factor functions in the following way:
%
% Pairwise factors: pass in an empty array (ie, []) for the pairwiseModel,
% and no pairwise factors will be added.
%
% Triplet factors: pass in an empty array for the tripletList, and no
% triplet factors will be added.
%
% Similarity factors: if you set imageModel.ignoreSimilarity = 1, then the
% similarity factors will not be added (nb: this is a bit of a kludge.
% Apologies.)
